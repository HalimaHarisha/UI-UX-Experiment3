## NAME: SOUNDARYA J
## REG NO: 212223220108
## Aim:
To perform a heuristic evaluation and comparative analysis of the Amazon.in and Flipkart homepages, identify usability issues, and suggest improvements to enhance user experience.

## Algorithm:
1.Select platforms – Amazon.in and Flipkart websites (homepages).
2.Apply Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics to both platforms.
3.Score each heuristic (1 = poor → 5 = excellent).
4.Identify issues and opportunities in UI/UX design for each platform.
5.Perform competitor comparison to highlight strengths and weaknesses.
6.Suggest improvements for usability, accessibility, and visual design.
7.Summarize findings in terms of heuristic averages and actionable recommendations.

## Key Observations
Amazon.in: Strong brand presence, powerful search, but suffers from cluttered header, oversized hero carousel, and accessibility contrast issues.
Flipkart: Cleaner navigation with slightly more consistency, better product tile density, but sometimes overly cluttered with offers.
## Recommended Changes
Amazon.in: Reduce header height, improve contrast, make search more prominent, restructure carousel to highlight product tiles.
Flipkart: Simplify promotional clutter, emphasize accessibility with better contrast, refine category icons.


## Result:
The heuristic evaluation shows that Flipkart scores slightly higher than Amazon.in in usability and consistency. However, both platforms can improve accessibility, minimalism, and help/documentation visibility. Implementing the suggested changes will enhance user navigation, discoverability, and trust, leading to a better overall user experience.
