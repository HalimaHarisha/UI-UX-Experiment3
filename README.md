# UI-UX-Experiment3
## NAME: HALIMA HARISHA A

## REG NO: 212224040094

## Aim:
To Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App To pick a website and its feature which I will be recreating as a ui ux designer .


## Algorithm:
## 1. Select Google Pay and Paytm as the applications for heuristic evaluation

In this step, two popular digital payment apps—Google Pay and Paytm—are chosen. 
These apps are selected because they are widely used and offer similar payment features, making them suitable for comparison.

## 2. Choose a core feature such as the UPI payment process for detailed analysis

Here, a common and important feature is selected for evaluation.
The UPI payment process is chosen because it is frequently used by users and plays a major role in the overall user experience of both applications.

## 3. Examine the UI components, navigation structure, and user interaction flow

In this step, the interface elements such as buttons, icons, colors, text, and layout are carefully observed.
Navigation flow (how users move from one screen to another) and interaction steps (scan, enter amount, confirm payment) are analyzed to understand ease of use.

## 4. Evaluate usability using Nielsen’s heuristic principles

Both apps are evaluated using usability guidelines proposed by Jakob Nielsen. 
These principles include visibility of system status, consistency, error prevention, feedback, and user control. 
This helps identify usability strengths and problems.

## 5. Identify and compare the strengths and usability issues of each application

After evaluation, the positive aspects (such as simplicity or speed) and usability issues (such as clutter or confusion) of Google Pay and Paytm are identified and compared to understand which app offers better user experience.

## 6. Suggest appropriate UI/UX design improvements based on the evaluation results

In the final step, design improvements are proposed based on the findings.
Suggestions may include simplifying layouts, improving navigation, reducing clutter, and enhancing feedback to create a better and more user-friendly UI/UX design.

## Key Observations
## Google Pay: 
It has a clean and simple interface that supports quick payments.

It provides clear and instant transaction feedback.

## Paytm:
It offers many services but has a cluttered home screen.

 
It requires more steps to complete basic payment tasks.

Overall, Google Pay is more user-friendly, while Paytm is feature-rich.

## Result:
The heuristic evaluation shows that Google Pay provides a simpler, more consistent, and user-friendly experience, with better system feedback and error prevention. Paytm, while feature-rich, feels more complex and cluttered, which affects ease of use. Overall, Google Pay scores higher in usability, whereas Paytm needs simplification and clearer navigation to improve the user experience.
